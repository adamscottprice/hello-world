# hello-world
My first repository, created whilst learning about github using one of the github guides.

I'm fairly inexperienced with coding. Just learnt a bit of C at uni, several years ago, and dabbled a bit with C++ and python. Keen to play around with all this deep learning and tensorflow stuff, so learning more about python atm.
